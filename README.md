## Usage
1. Download the latest release.
2. Extract it.
3. Copy an existing segment definition, or create your own. (There's a sample segment definition in the `Segments\` folder.)
4. Call `Snipper.exe` with your segment definition(s) and the files you'd like to snip as command-line arguments. (Or, you can click-and-drag the files onto the executable!)
5. Observe as your segments are dutifully snipped.

## Requirements
* Windows 10 64-bit or later.
